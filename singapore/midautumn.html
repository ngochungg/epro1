                <p><br>The Mid–Autumn Festival, also known as Moon Festival or Mooncake Festival, is a traditional festival celebrated by many East

                    It is the second-most important holiday after the Chinese New Year with a history dating back 3,000 years, 
                    when China's emperors worshipped the moon for bountiful harvests. The celebration is called Chuseok (autumn eve) in Korea and Tsukimi 
                    (moon-viewing) in Japan.

                    Lanterns of all size and shapes, are carried and displayed – as beacons to light our way to prosperity and good luck. Mooncakes, a rich pastry typically 
                    filled with sweet-bean or lotus-seed paste, are traditionally eaten during the festival.
