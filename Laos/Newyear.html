                <p>The official festival lasts for three days from 14 to 16 April, although celebrations can last more than a week in towns such as Luang Prabang. The first day is the last day of the old year. Houses and villages are properly cleaned on the first day. Perfume, water and flowers are also prepared for the Lao New Year. The second day of the festival is the "day of no year", a day that falls in neither the old year or the new year. The last day of the festival marks the start of the new year. In Laos, Lao New Year is a government holiday, with state offices closed during those three days.

                <h2>The first day</h2>
                <p>The Laotian called the first day of Boun Pi Mai is Maha Songkran, meaning the last day of the old year. Local people clean their houses, as well as prepare flowers to make the festival more unique and fabulous.

                    In addition to decorating the houses, people assemble in pagodas and temples for monkâ€™s lecture and praying Buddha. Especially, scented water is taken along to clean Buddha statues. Then the water dropping from the statues is collected to bring home and poured onto friends and relatives as an act of purification and fortune.
